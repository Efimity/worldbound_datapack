# Worldbound Datapack
Datapack for Minecraft 1.21+. Lets you make any item Worldbound; granting invulnerability to it while on the ground. Put it in the Smithing Table with a Netherite Scrap and a Netherite Upgrade Template to make it Worldbound.

## The Items that support Worldbound
You can make any time worldbound that supports enchantments, with one exclusion being Player Heads because of howthe datapack works in technical level.

## Adding new items that can be made Worldbound
You can do it by going into the data/worldbound/recipe/worldbound and copying one of the already existing recipes there, replacing the file name with the item you want to add to the list and changing it is content to replace "base" and "result" items to be the Item you are adding. For versions below 1.21.5, the path of the file is overlay_text_component/data/worldbound/recipe/worldbound. But what you need to do is basically the same.
