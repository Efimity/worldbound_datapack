# Worldbound Datapack
Datapack for Minecraft 1.21+. Lets you make any item Worldbound; granting invulnerability to it while on the ground. Put it in the Smithing Table with a Netherite Scrap and a Netherite Upgrade Template to make it Worldbound.

## The Items that support Worldbound
You can make any time worldbound that supports enchantments, with one exclusion being Player Heads because of howthe datapack works in technical level.

## How to Add More Items

- Go to `data/worldbound/recipe/worldbound`.
- Copy any of the existing recipe files.
- Rename the file to match the item you want to add.
- Inside the file, change the `"base"` and `"result"` fields to your item.

### For versions below 1.21.5
- The path is `overlay_text_component/data/worldbound/recipe/worldbound` instead.
- Everything else works the same way.
